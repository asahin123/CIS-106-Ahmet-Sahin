# CIS-106-Ahmet-Sahin

Hello, I'm Ahmet Sahin. I am a computer science student. I will be taking CIS-106 because programming is one of my essential needs to become one with computers. Also, after graduation, I will take courses for doing sales force which im looking for as my future job . CIS-106 will be my class to take my first step on coding and programming, so this course is too special for me. Moreover, I want to learn more about how to use programs more efficiently like excel for my job at the airport.
