# CIS-106-Ahmet-Sahin

## Assignment 1

Hello, I'm Ahmet Sahin. I am a computer science student. I will be taking CIS-106 because programming is one of my essential needs to become one with computers. Also, after graduation, I will take courses in doing sales force which I'm looking for as my future job. CIS-106 will be my class to take my first step in coding and programming, so this course is too special for me. Moreover, I want to learn more about how to use programs more efficiently, like Excel and Word, for my job at the airport. All in all, this course will be the first path of my future job , so I expect alot to learn from this class.Additionally, My curiosity about this class is, what are going to be my benefits after finishing the class. Can I start an internship anywhere? If not what elso should I do?

## Assignment 2

For my "Hello Name!" program, I will use the program called because my friends told me that is for beginners. Also, I don't want to have a hard experience at the beginning to start my journey in learning. To add more, is easier to understand. I will use Visual Studio Code for IDE because it gives many recommendations and has different color codes, making tracking the codes easier. Moreover, Visual Studio Code has many videos to introduce its usage, which also benefits me. For these reasons, and Visual Studio Code will be my partners for my CIS-106 class. Long live Visual Code Studio!!!

## Assignment 3

This assignment taught about how to use variables and to put them in the correct order. Using inputs and outputs to display whatever was needed. I selected the 2nd activity because I wanted to learn how to make arithmetic calculations and show them on a flowchart. I made a flowchart about age calculation and converted them into different variables such as years, months, days, hours, and seconds. My next goal is to make a detailed calculator that can calculate everythingâ€”for example, exponential numbers or limits. If there is no calculation, I want it to appear false if there are no possible calculations.  

## Assignment 4

I learned how to check my codes on the Visual Studio Code program for today's session. I also double-checked my principles by doing a flowchart for practice. Also, I realized that checking codes on Visual Studio Code is faster and easier to notice the changes. Every wrong code was showing in different colors, which was easier to detect the problem. The session felt like an extension of session three but in a better way, with more practice and understanding of the tools. On the other hand, I did the third activity for this session, which was familiar with my previous training. I practiced programming codes for arithmetic calculations and coding flowcharts.

## Assignment 5

In this session, I tried to create different functions in my flowchart to add to my previous homework and got the same results. I learned a new syntax, and it's called "call." With this syntax, I combined different flowcharts and brought together other grandfathers. I used Visual Studio Code to check that the codes were working and didn't get any wrong results. I also learned different types of scopes to understand my future designs better. Moreover, for this session, I gladly managed to write down my codes without no issues. I think I am getting better and more familiar with flowcharts.

## Assignment 6

For this week's session, I have learned how to type codes in Python. I have used Visual Studio Code to understand the problems of my errors. Furthermore, I made an appointment with my instructor to solve my problems to solve snake_case and main function issues. Also, to make the codes a hundred percent correct used algorithm and checked compared with the Python codes. Moreover, I just learned about the difference between snake_case and Camelcase. In the end, I think I mastered Python a little bit. My next goal is about to learn other regulations, so next session, I will start to use Javascript to add to my knowledge. 

## Assignment 7

This session taught me about a new flowchart symbol called "if/else." With this new symbol, I can add choices to my flowchart. With options added, I can navigate them to true or false. For Visual Studio Code, I have learned that "float" is a character that converts a string or number to a floating point number. Moreover, I added more functions and combined them into the "call" after the "if/else" symbol. In the future, I want to understand far deeper to realize about making choices in Python and to make the correct order to stop having malfunctions. After that, I want to try loops and have a program that keeps calculating whenever you enter an integer.


## Assignment 8

I learned about two new flowchart symbols in today's session: "while" and "for." With these new symbols, I can create loops. For example, with the Fibonacci experience I made for this session, I used a "while" loop to make the counts, and for the "for" loop, I connected each other to have the solution. All in all, I have learned about connecting circles and understanding their purposes. Next time, I will create a flowchart to use a "do" loop, which is also one of the three loop symbols in a flowchart. Moreover, I got used to the functions more than before.

## Assignment 9

I learned about while loops and their logic for this week's session. The while loops are used to repeat all pieces of code within a specific rule loop. The point note is that when the while loops, the code has to produce a FALSE result at some point. If this condition is wrong, the code continues to repeat indefinitely. Also, I turned back to the structure of functions. I remembered that processing functions could not have outputs or inputs. Overall, I have mastered the logic in while loops and understand the systems very well. I will use this advantage for my next session.

## Assignment 10

This week, the class taught me how the do-while loop works in the flowchart and what we use for programming. Its working logic and structure are the same as the while loop. The only difference is that the condition statement we specify at the beginning of the while loop is at the end of the do-while loop. The program continues without entering the loop if the condition statement does not meet in the while loop. Still, since this condition statement is placed at the end of the do-while loop, our program executes the operations in the do-while at least once.

## Assignment 11

This week, I have learned about the defined value arrays. Arrays are tough because understanding which array to use on a program takes time. For this reason, I needed help teaching arrays. However, I checked for definitions for arrays. I made myself understand arrays better, so To make a technical definition, data structures that keep the same data in the memory are called arrays. In programming, we can only hold one value on a variable. Arrays allow us to have more than one value under a variable. Also, the reference I shared with the class helped me understand the assignment for this week.

## Assignment 12

For this week, I have learned about dynamic arrays and used a different IDE called Pycharm. Also, acknowledged what is the difference between static and dynamic arrays and put them into action. The difference between them is the size. The size of the static directory cannot be changed during the program's run time. Later, this area will be emptied if desired. An array's size and the number of elements can be changed using some methods while the program runs. Such arrays are called dynamic arrays. To add more, the discussion board helped me again with the references they just gave me. Also, if I'm into Python, I will start using Pycharm as my IDE and use Visual Studio Code for Java and Javascript.

## Assignment 13

For this week, I have learned about strings. Strings are Inputs and outputs to the computer are in the form of strings; i.e., inputs and outputs are strings. Every language has a string (text) data type or can be obtained as strings of characters. It exists as a class in object-oriented languages. Hence, it is the most used data type in programming languages. There is a lot of work done with the String data type. For example, formatting the output, combining two texts, selecting a subtext of a text, converting letters, comparing two texts, and selecting a subtext or a character in a text. Methods that do things like searching are called string operations. For these reasons, this week provides the most important information about programming. I need to learn and master strings to be a programmer.

## Assignment 14

For this week,
