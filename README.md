# CIS-106-Ahmet-Sahin

## Assignment 1

Hello, I'm Ahmet Sahin. I am a computer science student. I will be taking CIS-106 because programming is one of my essential needs to become one with computers. Also, after graduation, I will take courses in doing sales force which I'm looking for as my future job. CIS-106 will be my class to take my first step in coding and programming, so this course is too special for me. Moreover, I want to learn more about how to use programs more efficiently, like Excel and Word, for my job at the airport. All in all, this course will be the first path of my future job , so I expect alot to learn from this class.Additionally, My curiosity about this class is, what are going to be my benefits after finishing the class. Can I start an internship anywhere? If not what elso should I do?

## Assignment 2

For my "Hello Name!" program, I will use the program called because my friends told me that is for beginners. Also, I don't want to have a hard experience at the beginning to start my journey in learning. To add more, is easier to understand. I will use Visual Studio Code for IDE because it gives many recommendations and has different color codes, making tracking the codes easier. Moreover, Visual Studio Code has many videos to introduce its usage, which also benefits me. For these reasons, and Visual Studio Code will be my partners for my CIS-106 class. Long live Visual Code Studio!!!

## Assignment 3

This assignment taught about how to use variables and to put them in the correct order. Using inputs and outputs to display whatever was needed. I selected the 2nd activity because I wanted to learn how to make arithmetic calculations and show them on a flowchart. I made a flowchart about age calculation and converted them into different variables such as years, months, days, hours, and seconds. My next goal is to make a detailed calculator that can calculate everythingâ€”for example, exponential numbers or limits. If there is no calculation, I want it to appear false if there are no possible calculations.  

## Assignment 4

I learned how to check my codes on the Visual Studio Code program for today's session. I also double-checked my principles by doing a flowchart for practice. Also, I realized that checking codes on Visual Studio Code is faster and easier to notice the changes. Every wrong code was showing in different colors, which was easier to detect the problem. The session felt like an extension of session three but in a better way, with more practice and understanding of the tools. On the other hand, I did the third activity for this session, which was familiar with my previous training. I practiced programming codes for arithmetic calculations and coding flowcharts.

## Assignment 5

In this session, I tried to create different functions in my flowchart to add to my previous homework and got the same results. I learned a new syntax, and it's called "call." With this syntax, I combined different flowcharts and brought together other grandfathers. I used Visual Studio Code to check that the codes were working and didn't get any wrong results. I also learned different types of scopes to understand my future designs better. Moreover, for this session, I gladly managed to write down my codes without no issues. I think I am getting better and more familiar with flowcharts.

## Assignment 6

For this week's session, I have learned how to type codes in Python. I have used Visual Studio Code to understand the problems of my errors. Furthermore, I made an appointment with my instructor to solve my problems to solve snake_case and main function issues. Also, to make the codes a hundred percent correct used algorithm and checked compared with the Python codes. Moreover, I just learned about the difference between snake_case and Camelcase. In the end, I think I mastered Python a little bit. My next goal is about to learn other regulations, so next session, I will start to use Javascript to add to my knowledge. 

## Assignment 7

This session taught me about a new flowchart symbol called "if/else." With this new symbol, I can add choices to my flowchart. With options added, I can navigate them to true or false. For Visual Studio Code, I have learned that "float" is a character that converts a string or number to a floating point number. Moreover, I added more functions and combined them into the "call" after the "if/else" symbol. In the future, I want to understand far deeper to realize about making choices in Python and to make the correct order to stop having malfunctions. After that, I want to try loops and have a program that keeps calculating whenever you enter an integer.


## Assignment 8

I learned about two new flowchart symbols in today's session: "while" and "for." With these new symbols, I can create loops. For example, with the Fibonacci experience I made for this session, I used a "while" loop to make the counts, and for the "for" loop, I connected each other to have the solution. All in all, I have learned about connecting circles and understanding their purposes. Next time, I will create a flowchart to use a "do" loop, which is also one of the three loop symbols in a flowchart. Moreover, I got used to the functions more than before.
