# CIS-106-Ahmet-Sahin

## Assignment 1

Hello, I'm Ahmet Sahin. I am a computer science student. I will be taking CIS-106 because programming is one of my essential needs to become one with computers. Also, after graduation, I will take courses in doing sales force which I'm looking for as my future job. CIS-106 will be my class to take my first step in coding and programming, so this course is too special for me. Moreover, I want to learn more about how to use programs more efficiently, like Excel and Word, for my job at the airport. All in all, this course will be the first path of my future job , so I expect alot to learn from this class.Additionally, My curiosity about this class is, what are going to be my benefits after finishing the class. Can I start an internship anywhere? If not what elso should I do?

## Assignment 2

For my "Hello Name!" program, I will use the program called Phyton because my friends told me that Phyton is for beginners. Also, I don't want to have a hard experience at the beginning to start my journey in learning. I will use Visual Studio Code for IDE because it gives many recommendations (in every app like Phyton) and has different color codes, making tracking easier.
