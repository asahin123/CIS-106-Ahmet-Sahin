Also, I don't want to have a hard experience at the beginning to start my journey in learning. To add more, is easier to understand. I will use Visual Studio Code for IDE because it gives many recommendations and has different color codes, making tracking the codes easier. Moreover, Visual Studio Code has many videos to introduce its usage, which also benefits me. For these reasons, and Visual Studio Code will be my partners for my CIS-106 class.

## Assignment 3

This assignment taught about how to use variables and to put them in the correct order. Using inputs and outputs to display whatever was needed. I selected the 2nd activity because I wanted to learn how to make arithmetic calculations and show them on a flowchart. I made a flowchart about age calculation and converted them into different variables such as years, months, days, hours, and seconds. My next goal is to make a detailed calculator that can calculate everythingâ€”for example, exponential numbers or limits. If there is no calculation, I want it to appear false if there are no possible calculations.
