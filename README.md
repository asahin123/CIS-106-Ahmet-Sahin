# CIS-106-Ahmet-Sahin

## Assignment 1

Hello, I'm Ahmet Sahin. I am a computer science student. I will be taking CIS-106 because programming is one of my essential needs to become one with computers. Also, after graduation, I will take courses in doing sales force which I'm looking for as my future job. CIS-106 will be my class to take my first step in coding and programming, so this course is too special for me. Moreover, I want to learn more about how to use programs more efficiently, like excel, for my job at the airport.
