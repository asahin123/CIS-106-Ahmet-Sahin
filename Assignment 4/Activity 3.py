# This program shows how to calculate the expected distance in milesi into kilometers, meters, and centimeters.

Expectingmiles = int(input())

distance = miles
kilometers = miles * 1.609344
meters = miles * 1609.344
centimeters = miles * 160934.4

print(" kilometers=" + str(kilometers))
print(" meters=" + str(meters))
print(" centimeters=" + str(centimeters))

# References: For this session, I took help from my friend who also does coding.
