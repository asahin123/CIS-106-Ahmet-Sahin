This program demonstrates while loop counting using the Fibonacci sequence based on a given number of iterations entered by the user.

Main Program
    
    Get Iteration Number
    Process Fibonacci Sequence

Get Iteration Number
    
    Parameters:
        
        None
    
    Process:
        
        Enter Iteration Number
        Get value
    
    Return value:
        
        Value

Demonstrate While Loop
    
    Parameters:
        
        iteration Number
   
    Process:
        
        Initialize i
        Loop for i from i equals to 3 to iterationNumber
             i increased by 1
